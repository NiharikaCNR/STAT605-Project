# Question
Write a one-page proposal (4 points) including code to read data; descriptions of the variables, statistical methods, and computational steps you will use; and a link to your github repository. Turn in a `proposal.html` (knitted from `proposal.Rmd` or from some other source) or a `proposal.pdf`, one per group.
