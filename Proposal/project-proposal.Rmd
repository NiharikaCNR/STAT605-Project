# Project Description

## Problem Statement

+ Providing artist/track popularity analysis to business owners (entertainment label representatives in this case).
+ The analysis could help them market new artists they plan on launching.

## Questions
We are hoping to answer some of these questions through our analysis

__Analysis Questions:__

+ Who is the most popular artist per genre every year? (summary analysis)
+ Top 5 search queries associated with an a track/artist (user input)
+ The top 5 genres of (top 10?) artists on a given year (user input)
+ Is there any correlation between the popularity of an artist and the chances of their songs being included in a playlist for that genre?

__Modeling Questions:__

+ What are the significant factors that influence the popularity of an artist? (Figuring out factors that are statistically significant?)
+ Given a combination of music genres, can we predict the popularity of a track?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
main_data = read_csv("../data/main_dataset.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(main_data)
```

# Description of Variables

description_of_variables = read_csv("description_of_variables.csv")
kable(description_of_variables, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```
